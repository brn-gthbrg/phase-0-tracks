# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the ability to track and keep separate versions of the same code. Like alternate timelines that can be merged together. It's useful for testing changes before making changes to the master version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a repo. It is like a "separate timeline" that can be edited so the master version isn't affected, in case anything goes wrong.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is applying the changes on a branch to the master.A good commit message has a short and specific description  of the changes. Capitalize the subject line

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there are commits in one branch that aren't in another and vice versa. These need to be resolved to commit the changes.
