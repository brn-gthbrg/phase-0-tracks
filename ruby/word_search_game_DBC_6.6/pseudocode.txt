# Create a class for game
# Initialize
	# @secret_word is input
	# @guess_count equals the length of secret_word
# guess_countdown method: 
	# if the guess exists in a past_guess array, do not subtract 1 from the guess_count
	# if the guess doesnâ€™t exist in a past_guess array, subtract 1 from the guess_count
# letter_check method:
	# check if secret_word includes the input letter
	# if yes find and replace the hidden letter in secret_word and subtract guess_count
	# if it does not, tell user incorrect and subtract guess_count


# User Interface
	# Ask first user for word
	# Hide word from second user
	# Ask user2 to guess a letter
	# Take letter user2 enters and check against input word from user1
